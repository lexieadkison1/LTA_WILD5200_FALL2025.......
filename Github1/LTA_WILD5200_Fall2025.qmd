Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The epidemiological triad is a model used to explain how diseases occur and spread. It consists of three interconnected components: the host (the organism that can get the disease), the agent (the pathogen or cause of the disease, such as a virus, bacterium, or parasite), and the environment (the external factors that influence disease transmission, like climate, sanitation, or living conditions). Disease develops when these three elements interact in a way that allows the agent to infect the host under favorable environmental conditions. This model helps researchers and health professionals understand and control the spread of diseases
