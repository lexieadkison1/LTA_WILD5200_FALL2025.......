The epidemiological triad is a model used to explain how diseases occur and spread. It consists of three interconnected components: the host (the organism that can get the disease), the agent (the pathogen or cause of the disease, such as a virus, bacterium, or parasite), and the environment (the external factors that influence disease transmission, like climate, sanitation, or living conditions). Disease develops when these three elements interact in a way that allows the agent to infect the host under favorable environmental conditions. This model helps researchers and health professionals understand and control the spread of diseases.

Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

![](images/clipboard-1408093617.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    -   The necessary sample size is 59

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    -   95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population. 299\
    -   99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population. 229

    The sample size required for scenario A is larger

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is

# Tick Identification Write Up - 10/6/25

Tick identification relies on observing key morphological features through a structured approach. The process typically follows the sequence of determining life stage, sex, genus, and species. First, the life stage is identified by checking for a genital pore and counting legs, with six in larvae and eight in nymphs and adults. Next, sex is determined by examining the scutum; males have a full scutum called a conscutum, while females have a smaller one called an alloscutum. Genus identification depends on the position of the anal groove, which may be anterior or posterior to the anus. Species-level identification is achieved using a dichotomous key. The SAM method, which stands for scutum, anal groove, and mouth parts, helps distinguish tick types by observing scutum patterns, anal groove location, and the length of mouth parts. Accurate tick identification is vital in public health because different species transmit specific pathogens such as Lyme disease, Ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Understanding these features supports effective disease surveillance and prevention strategies.

# Test Correction (#7 and #8) - 10/13/25

7.  In 2015, the mass die-off of Saiga antelope in Kazakhstan was caused by a bacterial infection from *Pasteurella multocida* type B, which is normally harmless in healthy animals but became deadly under unusually warm and humid conditions. These environmental changes triggered the bacteria, already present in the animals’ respiratory tracts, to turn virulent and cause hemorrhagic septicemia, leading to rapid death across entire herds within days. The dense grouping of Saigas during calving season further accelerated disease transmission and mortality. To prevent similar events, conservationists could establish early-warning systems that monitor weather patterns, herd health, and soil or microbial conditions linked to outbreaks. Regular disease surveillance, carcass disposal protocols, and genetic diversity management would also reduce vulnerability. Broader conservation strategies should focus on maintaining large, connected populations across multiple regions, reducing poaching, and protecting habitat corridors so that Saigas can disperse and avoid catastrophic losses from localized disease outbreaks. Strengthening international cooperation for disease response and data sharing would further safeguard the species from extinction.

8.  Yes, I agree with Aldo Leopold’s perspective that wildlife disease is largely an ecological issue influenced by human actions. Human-driven habitat changes, climate shifts, and artificial animal concentrations often create conditions that favor disease outbreaks. For example, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in deer has spread more rapidly because of captive deer farming and the transport of animals across states—human activities that disrupt natural population structures. Similarly, the spread of chytridiomycosis in amphibians has been linked to the global pet trade and movement of infected species, such as the African clawed frog, which introduced the fungus to new ecosystems. These examples show that many wildlife diseases emerge or intensify when human behavior alters ecological balance, supporting Leopold’s view that managing disease requires understanding and addressing our own environmental impacts.

# Worksheet 4 - 10/17/25

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April 2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

![](images/clipboard-3333916480.png)

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? *(If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)*

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.
    -   Incorrect. MERS-CoV is not primarily maintained in humans; it is maintained in dromedary camels, which are the main reservoir. Human infections typically occur through spillover from camels to humans, with limited human-to-human transmission.
2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.
    -   Correct
3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.
    -   Correct
4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%.
    -   Incorrect. The actual estimated case fatality rate (CFR) is about 35%, not 65%. This estimate is based on reported confirmed cases and deaths since the virus was first identified in 2012.
5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak.
    -   Incorrect. The epidemic curve for MERS-CoV does not show a point source outbreak. Instead, it reflects sporadic zoonotic spillover events and limited human-to-human transmission, often associated with healthcare settings and multiple peaks over time.

# Worksheet 5 - 10/28/2025

Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024 The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    -   The 2024 Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda was a spillover event, not an emerging infectious disease. Genomic analysis showed it began with a single transmission from Egyptian rousette bats to humans, followed by limited spread among healthcare workers. Since the Marburg virus is already known, this outbreak reflected zoonotic spillover and nosocomial amplification rather than the emergence of a new pathogen. Most infections occurred in hospitals through exposure to blood and body fluids, making it a controlled, localized event rather than a novel epidemic.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

    -   To reduce transmission, Rwanda used rapid detection, community education, and strict infection control. People were advised to avoid bat caves and practice safe caregiving and burial methods. Contact tracing and 21-day monitoring helped contain community spread. In hospitals, workers used PPE, isolation wards, triage systems, and buddy checks for donning and doffing equipment. Improved ventilation, exposure tracking, and daily symptom checks further protected staff. Strong supportive care, including Africa’s first use of mechanical ventilation for Marburg patients, raised survival to 77%, proving that early treatment and equitable care can effectively stop transmission.

# Worksheet 6 - 11/6/25

1.  A new disease, Vertico, has been detected in fish in two separate ponds. Your task is to analyze the sample data to determine and compare the disease prevalence between the two ponds. Determine Prevalence. Use the online tool QPweb to calculate the prevalence of Vertico in each pond.

    -   Pond 1 = 0.300

    -   Pond 2 = 0.06

    Report the prevalence as a percentage (e.g., 0.35 → 35%).

    -   Pond 1 = 30%

    -   Pond 2 = 6.7%

2.  Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Use QPweb to calculate the 95% CI for each prevalence estimate.

    -   Pond 1 LCI = 0.140, UCl = 0.525

    -   Pond 2 LCI = 0.003, UCl = 0.302

    Report the CI values as percentages, rounded meaningfully

    -   Pond 1 LCI = 14%, UCI = 52.5%

    -   Pond 2 LCI= 0.3%, UCI = 30.2%

3.  Compare Prevalence Between the Two Ponds\

    a.  Perform a Fisher’s exact test to compare the two prevalence values.

    -   Pond 1 prevalence = 30.0

    -   Pond 2 prevalence = 6.7

        \

        b.  Report the p-value.

    -   0.1987

    c\. State whether the difference is statistically significant.

    -   p = 0.1987 \> 0.05. Not statistically significant. There is no evidence that the prevalence of Vertico differs significantly between Pond 1 and Pond 2.

# Worksheet 7 - 11/12/25

1.  Nipah Virus Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

    -   The ecology of Nipah virus varies significantly between Malaysia and Bangladesh, resulting in different transmission patterns and corresponding prevention strategies. In Malaysia, the primary mode of transmission during the 1998–1999 outbreak was from pigs to humans, with pigs serving as amplifying hosts after becoming infected from fruit bats. Most human cases occurred in pig farmers and slaughterhouse workers who had close, repeated contact with infected pigs or their secretions. As a result, prevention efforts in Malaysia focused heavily on livestock management, including mass culling of pigs, strict movement controls, enhanced farm biosecurity, and the use of protective equipment when handling swine. In contrast, outbreaks in Bangladesh have been driven mainly by direct bat-to-human transmission, especially through the consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated with bat saliva or urine. Human-to-human transmission has also played a larger role in Bangladesh, particularly within households and healthcare settings. Therefore, prevention strategies there emphasize covering date palm sap collection pots, boiling sap before consumption, promoting behavior changes to avoid contaminated foods, and implementing strict infection control practices in hospitals. These differences demonstrate how ecological and cultural factors shape the virus’s transmission routes and the appropriate preventive measures for each region.

2.  Avian Reovirus Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

    -   Avian reoviruses (ARVs) spread through several transmission routes, including fecal–oral exposure, inhalation of contaminated aerosols, vertical transmission from infected hens to chicks, and entry through breaks in the skin. Horizontal transmission, especially via the fecal–oral route, is the most common because ARV is shed in high concentrations and contaminates litter, feed, water, and surfaces. Environmental factors that favor ARV transmission include high bird density, damp or poorly sanitized housing, and enclosed indoor areas where virus-laden dust can accumulate. One important pathogen characteristic supporting fecal–oral spread is that ARVs are non-enveloped viruses, which makes them highly stable in the environment and able to survive for long periods in feces and on surfaces. This durability increases the likelihood that birds will ingest infectious material. In wild birds, ARV-associated disease has been documented in American crows, especially in large winter roosts where crowding and contaminated droppings allow rapid transmission. These outbreaks can cause notable winter mortality and contribute to disease spread among dense crow populations.

3.  Langya henipavirus Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

    -   Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus most likely maintained in nature by shrews, which show the highest rate of viral detection among sampled animals. Human infections appear to result from spillover events involving direct or indirect contact with infected shrews or environments contaminated by their secretions, with occasional positive detections in goats or dogs likely reflecting secondary exposure from shrews rather than serving as major reservoirs. Importantly, no evidence supports sustained human-to-human transmission, and identified human cases have been sporadic, geographically limited, and relatively mild. Because the virus has not shown signs of increasing incidence, adaptation to humans, or widespread transmission, it is considered a spillover infection rather than a potential emerging infectious disease (EID). LayV currently presents as isolated zoonotic events rather than a virus poised for broader human spread.

# Worksheet 8 - 11/17/25

The analysis of the Baylisascaris procyonis data, based on the 106 raccoon records, reveals distinct and significant patterns. The overall prevalence of B. procyonis is 47.17% (50 infected out of 106), indicating that nearly half of the raccoons were hosts to the parasite. This infection rate is supported by an overall mean intensity of 9.44 worms per infected host. The most substantial variation is observed across regions and sex. The Central (64.29% prevalence) and South (62.79% prevalence) regions exhibit dramatically higher infection rates and mean intensities (12.22 and 11.59 worms, respectively) compared to the North region (28.57% prevalence and 3.50 worms intensity), strongly suggesting that the parasite's eggs are concentrated in the central and southern environments. Furthermore, female raccoons are at a much higher risk overall, with a prevalence of 64.86% (95% CI: 48.76% to 78.17%), compared to the male prevalence of 37.68% (95% CI: 27.18% to 49.48%). Infected females also carry a far greater worm burden, with a mean intensity of 13.96 worms, more than double the 5.27 worms found in infected males. This sex-based disparity is most pronounced in the South region, where the prevalence of South Female raccoons reaches 100.00% (95% CI: 74.12% to 100.00%), highlighting this specific subgroup as the primary reservoir for the parasite. Finally, Adult raccoons show a slightly higher prevalence (52.17%) than Young Adults (37.84%), a finding consistent with cumulative exposure risk over the host's lifespan. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that B. procyonis transmission and burden are highly localized to the Central and South regions, and female raccoons, particularly in the South, are the most heavily infected group, representing the greatest risk for environmental contamination.

# Worksheet 9 - 11/21/25

1.  In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

    -   In the 2024 multistate Salmonella outbreak linked to backyard poultry, several human behaviors contributed directly to the spread of the pathogen. Many backyard poultry owners handled their birds closely by holding, cuddling, or even kissing them, and some allowed poultry inside the home or in areas where food and drinks were prepared. Because poultry can carry Salmonella on their feathers, feet, and environment even when they look healthy, this close contact greatly increased the chance of exposure. Another major factor was inadequate hand hygiene. People often failed to wash their hands after touching birds, collecting eggs, or handling objects from the coop, which made it easy for Salmonella to transfer from contaminated hands to the mouth during eating or drinking. A third behavior involved bringing contaminated items, such as shoes worn in the coop or feed containers, into the house and allowing young children to interact with birds without proper supervision. These practices transported Salmonella from outdoor poultry environments into living spaces, significantly increasing the risk of human infection.

2.  Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

    -   What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte?
        -   Tall fescue gains several advantages from being infected with the fungal endophyte *Epichloë coenophiala*. The fungus produces protective alkaloids that deter insect herbivores and enhance the plant’s tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought and heat. This relationship allows endophyte-infected tall fescue to persist longer, remain more vigorous, and outcompete endophyte-free plants in many grazing systems.
    -   What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?
        -   The occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock are influenced by several interacting environmental and ecological factors. The concentration of alkaloids, particularly ergovaline, is a primary driver, with higher levels increasing the likelihood of toxicosis. Seasonal conditions also play a major role. Hot and humid weather intensifies heat stress in cattle whose circulation is already impaired by alkaloid-induced vasoconstriction, while cold weather can worsen poor circulation and contribute to conditions such as fescue foot. The growth stage of the plant matters because alkaloid concentrations tend to be higher in seed heads and over-mature forage. Grazing management is equally important; overgrazing, drought, and limited forage choices force cattle to consume more infected tall fescue, increasing their intake of alkaloids.
    -   What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?
        -   The key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle include reduced feed intake, poor weight gain, rough hair coat, and an overall decline in body condition. Affected cattle commonly struggle with heat intolerance because the alkaloids restrict blood flow, making it difficult for them to dissipate heat. Reproductive performance is also impacted, leading to reduced fertility, lower milk production, and lighter calves. In colder weather, severe vasoconstriction can cause fescue foot, a condition marked by lameness and tissue damage to the extremities, including the tail, ears, and hooves. These signs reflect the widespread physiological stress caused by endophyte-derived alkaloids.

# Worksheet 10 - 11/21/25

1.  What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

    -   African Swine Fever spreads through several major transmission routes, including direct contact between infected and susceptible pigs, ingestion of contaminated pork products, and exposure to infectious materials in the environment. The virus enters pigs primarily through the oronasal route, and it can persist for long periods in meat, carcasses, and contaminated fomites such as boots, vehicles, feed, and equipment. In Africa, a sylvatic cycle involving wild suids like warthogs and bushpigs and soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros maintains the virus, with ticks acting as biological vectors capable of transmitting infection between hosts. In regions with wild or feral pig populations, carcass contact and environmental contamination are especially important for maintaining the disease. Although humans cannot contract African Swine Fever, they play a major role in spreading it by unintentionally moving contaminated materials, transporting infected pigs or pork products, feeding pigs untreated kitchen waste, and failing to follow proper biosecurity. Because most long-distance introductions of African Swine Fever are tied to human activity rather than wildlife, strict biosecurity and careful control of pig products are essential for preventing outbreaks.

2.  Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

    -   Co-infection with Koala Retrovirus significantly influences the severity and progression of Chlamydia pecorum infection in koalas. Many studies show that koalas infected with certain Koala Retrovirus subtypes, especially the more pathogenic exogenous subtype KoRV B, are more likely to develop severe clinical disease instead of remaining asymptomatic carriers. This occurs because the retrovirus can alter or suppress important components of the koala’s immune system, reducing the animal’s ability to control chlamydial infections and allowing disease to progress to serious ocular or urogenital problems. Although results vary among different koala populations, the overall trend indicates that retroviral infection compromises immune function, interacts with host genetics, and increases disease susceptibility. These interactions complicate management because treating Chlamydia alone is not enough, and conservation programs must consider Koala Retrovirus status when planning rehabilitation, translocations, or vaccination efforts. Effective management strategies include vaccination against Chlamydia pecorum, careful antibiotic use, screening for Koala Retrovirus subtypes, and reducing environmental stress that further harms immune function.

3.  Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)?

    -   Snake Fungal Disease, caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, presents several major challenges for surveillance and management in wild snake populations. Snakes are naturally cryptic, solitary, and difficult to sample consistently, which makes detecting the disease or estimating its true prevalence extremely difficult. Clinical signs vary widely among species and individuals, and some snakes show obvious lesions while others appear healthy even when infected, which complicates field diagnosis. Surveillance is further limited by uneven sampling across regions, seasonal changes in snake activity and detectability, and a lack of baseline data on normal skin conditions in many species. Management is equally challenging because effective treatment on a large scale is not feasible for wild populations, and the fungus can persist in the environment, allowing ongoing exposure. Human activities such as fieldwork and equipment movement can inadvertently spread the pathogen, and additional stressors like habitat loss or climate change may worsen disease outcomes. Together, these challenges highlight the need for improved diagnostics, standardized monitoring programs, strict field biosecurity, and careful risk assessment during conservation actions such as translocations.

December 2, 2025 WILD 5200

1.  True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect (10 points)

    -   Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and no within–target species transmission will be termed a spillover.

        **TRUE**

    -   A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious.

        **FALSE**. The disease is infectious but is not contagious. Contagious diseases are spread by direct or indirect host-to-host contact; a disease requiring a vector (like a mosquito or tick) is not considered contagious.

    -   The eggs of Baylisascaris procyonis can be transmitted to humans by direct contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon.

        **FALSE.** The eggs are not immediately infective upon excretion. They must undergo an incubation period in the environment to embryonate and become infectious to humans.

    -   A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production.

        **TRUE**

    -   Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus.

        **FALSE**. American Robins are typically considered the superspreader species for West Nile virus due to their high viremia and frequent feeding by Culex mosquitoes, the primary vectors

2.  List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? (10 points)

    -   Community-based interventions for preventing dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) transmission focus on breaking the cycle where the intermediate host, Cyclops (copepods), contaminates drinking water. Key interventions include: providing safe drinking water sources (like boreholes) to avoid contaminated water; water filtration using fine-mesh cloth or pipe filters to physically remove the Cyclops; and case containment and treatment, which involves isolating infected people and bandaging the emerging worm to prevent the release of L1 larvae into water. Additionally, larvicide application (temephos) is used to kill the intermediate host in stagnant water bodies. These strategies have evolved due to the emergence of infections in dogs. Current management now includes active animal surveillance and tethering or containing infected dogs to prevent them from entering water sources. Furthermore, community education emphasizes preventing dogs from consuming raw fish or fish offal, which can contain the parasite and lead to infection.

3.  Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD? (10 points)

    -   Managing Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in cervids is profoundly difficult due to several factors. First, the infectious agents, prions, are highly resistant and exhibit environmental persistence, remaining infectious in soil for years, which makes site decontamination virtually impossible. Second, CWD has an extremely long incubation period (months to years), meaning infected animals can appear healthy while actively shedding prions, complicating early detection and targeted removal. Third, unlike diseases in domestic animals, there is no approved vaccine or practical treatment for CWD in free-ranging wildlife, limiting management tools to population reduction and surveillance. Finally, management actions such as targeted culling or restrictions on carcass movement often face significant opposition from hunters, landowners, and the public, hindering the effective implementation of control strategies.

4.  You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos monitored at sampling stations (no capture required). At the start of the study (December 2024) none were infected with Mycobacterium leprae. During the follow-up period, monthly assessments documented the following counts of infected animals in the population:

    • March 2025: 3 infected

    • April 2025: 5 infected

    • May 2025: 5 infected

    • June 2025: 8 infected

    • July 2025: 13 infected

    (No deaths, births, immigration, or recovery occurred during the study.)

    a\. Calculate the monthly incidence of M. leprae infection. Show your calculations and state the units. (5 points)

    Incidence is the rate of new infections occurring in the population at risk (susceptible hosts) over a specific period. The formula used is:

    Incidence = Number of New Cases in Time Period/ Population at Risk at Start of Time Period

    The Population at Risk is the total population minus the existing infected individuals at the start of that period.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|------------|------------|------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Time Period** | **Infected (Start → End)** | **New Cases** | **Susceptible at Start** | **Calculation** | **Incidence** |
| **Mar 2025 - Apr 2025** | $3 \rightarrow 5$ | $5 - 3 = 2$ | $60 - 3 = 57$ | $2 / 57 \approx 0.035$ | $3.5\%$ |

5.  A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia.

    a\. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers? (2 points)

    -   The etiological agent (the organism that causes the disease) is the bacterium *Francisella tularensis*. The subspecies typically responsible for infections in aquatic animals, such as beavers and muskrats, is *Francisella tularensis* subspecies holarctica, often referred to as Type B. This Type B strain is generally less virulent in humans than the Type A strain, which is common in rabbits and hares.

    b\. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent? (2 points)

    -   *Francisella tularensis* is highly versatile and can be transmitted through several routes:
        1.  Inoculation/Contact: The bacterium can enter the body through cuts, abrasions, or mucous membranes when handling infected animal carcasses (e.g., skinning a beaver) or by the bite of an infected animal.

        2.  Ingestion: Consumption of undercooked meat from an infected animal (though rare for beavers, it applies to game species) or by drinking contaminated water (often found near infected animal habitats).

        3.  Vector-borne: Transmission via the bite of infected arthropods, primarily ticks and deer flies, which maintain the natural cycle of the disease.

        4.  Inhalation: Breathing in aerosolized bacteria, which can occur during farming, mowing, or when stirring up dust contaminated with excreta from infected rodents.

    c\. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/public health. (3 points)

    -   *Francisella tularensis*, the bacterium causing Tularemia, is highly concerning for human and public health due to its severe infectivity and classification. Most notably, it is designated as a Category A Bioterrorism Agent by the CDC, highlighting its potential for mass dissemination and high rates of illness or death. This threat stems from the pathogen's extremely low infectious dose, meaning a very small number of inhaled organisms can cause disease in humans. The disease's clinical outcome is serious, as the pulmonary form—often resulting from inhalation exposure—can manifest as severe pneumonic tularemia, which carries a high fatality rate if prompt diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are not initiated.

8.  Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. (10 points)

    -   The Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) CWD surveillance approach, utilizing a large sample size of 1351 hunter-harvested deer from an estimated population of approximately 1 million, is a common and practical method for achieving cost-effective, broad-scale surveillance. The resulting conclusion, determined by the hypergeometric distribution, states that CWD is not present above a 0.2% prevalence in the state. However, the critical downside of relying on this statistical methodology is that the result is an absence of evidence, not evidence of absence. This clearance threshold only provides confidence that the disease is not common above that specific level; if CWD is present at a very low prevalence (e.g., 0.1%) or is highly localized, the 1351 sample size may still result in zero positives, leading to a false-negative conclusion. This creates a dangerous risk of management complacency, potentially leading the agency to reduce or cease ongoing surveillance efforts. Given the long, asymptomatic incubation period of CWD, this undetected spread allows the disease to establish and amplify silently, only to be discovered years later at a much higher prevalence that is exponentially more difficult and costly to control.

    -   Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your choice of quadrants. (10 points)

        |  |  |  |
        |------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
        | Disease | Quadrant | Rationale |
        | a\. SARS-CoV-2 | Top Right | High β12​, High β22​. It successfully spilled over from animals (high β12​) and established highly sustained human-to-human spread (high β22​). |
        | b\. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) | Bottom Right | High β12​, Low β22​. Transmitted readily from rodents to humans (high β12​), but humans are dead-end hosts with essentially no human-to-human transmission (β22​≈0). |
        | c\. Langya Henipavirus (LayV) | Bottom Right | High β12​, Low β22​. Shows spillover from animals (high β12​), but current evidence suggests human-to-human spread is limited or absent (β22​≈0). |
        | d\. Brucellosis | Top Right | High β12​, High β22​. It spills over to humans (high β12​) and maintains endemic, high transmission within its maintenance hosts (high β22​). |
        | e\. West Nile Virus (WNV) | Bottom Right | High β12​, Low β22​. Transmitted from the bird/mosquito cycle to humans (high β12​), but humans are dead-end hosts with no sustained human-to-human transmission (β22​≈0). |

10. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm Anisakis simplex. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers. (8 points)

    ![](images/clipboard-2821629160.png)

    |  |  |  |
    |------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
    | Host Role | Host | Explanation (Based on Life Cycle) |
    | Definitive Host | Marine mammals | The definitive host is where the parasite reaches sexual maturity and reproduces. The figure shows the parasite developing into L3 → L4 → adults and defecating eggs in marine mammals. |
    | Intermediate Host | Crustaceans | The intermediate host harbors the larval or asexual stage and is essential for the completion of the life cycle. Crustaceans ingest the free-living L3 larvae. |
    | Paratenic Host | Seafish and cephalopods | A paratenic host (or transport host) harbors the infective larval stage (L3) but is not essential for development; it simply bridges the infection to the definitive host. The seafish/cephalopods ingest the infected crustaceans. |
    | Dead-End Host | Humans | A dead-end host is infected but cannot transmit the parasite back to the environment to complete the life cycle. Humans become infected by ingesting raw or undercooked seafish but the larvae do not reach maturity and the cycle terminates. |

11. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. (3 points)

    -   The statement "All infected hosts are diseased" is false. This assertion is incorrect because it fails to recognize the critical difference between the concepts of infection and disease. Infection refers only to the presence of a pathogen within a host organism. In contrast, disease is the manifestation of clinical signs or symptoms resulting from the damage or dysfunction caused by the pathogen. Consequently, many infected hosts are asymptomatic carriers; they harbor the infectious agent and may be able to spread it, but they do not exhibit clinical illness. Appropriate examples illustrating this distinction include individuals with latent Tuberculosis (TB) infection, who are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis but are clinically healthy, and wildlife species affected by diseases like Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), which often undergo a long asymptomatic incubation period where they are infected and shedding the pathogen before any clinical signs of the disease appear.

12. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV? (3 points)
    -   1-1/2.5 = 1-0.4 = 0.6
13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples.
    -   One primary challenge is inaccessibility and logistical difficulty. Unlike livestock or human populations, wildlife are mobile, dispersed, and often live in remote areas, which makes standard interventions such as mass treatment, individual vaccination, or quarantine virtually impossible to implement on a large scale. For example, it is technologically and financially infeasible to capture and individually vaccinate every wild animal against a disease like Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) or to treat every free-ranging bat against White-Nose Syndrome.

        A second major issue is the lack of practical and approved interventions. Effective vaccines or therapeutic drugs are often not available or suitable for wide-scale field application, as they would need to be safe, environmentally stable, and easily deliverable (e.g., orally). For diseases like Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), there is currently no effective vaccine or treatment available for free-ranging cervids, leaving population reduction as one of the few management options.

        Finally, many wildlife diseases are zoonotic and involve complex multi-host systems, requiring the management of multiple species simultaneously. This ecological complexity is compounded by public and political opposition to necessary control methods, such as targeted culling or habitat alteration, hindering the full, timely implementation of management strategies.
