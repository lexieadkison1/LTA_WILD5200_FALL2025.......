Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

The epidemiological triad is a model used to explain how diseases occur and spread. It consists of three interconnected components: the host (the organism that can get the disease), the agent (the pathogen or cause of the disease, such as a virus, bacterium, or parasite), and the environment (the external factors that influence disease transmission, like climate, sanitation, or living conditions). Disease develops when these three elements interact in a way that allows the agent to infect the host under favorable environmental conditions. This model helps researchers and health professionals understand and control the spread of diseases.

Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

![](images/clipboard-1408093617.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
    herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    The necessary sample size is 59

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:\

    a)  95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population. 299\
    b)  99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population. 229

    The sample size required for scenario A is larger

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is

    \<1%

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her\
data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She\
meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:\
RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

![](images/clipboard-3296816889.png)

1.  Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

    1.  06/12: 5 new / 51 susceptible = 9.8% per day

    2.  06/14: 2 new / 44 susceptible = 4.6% per day

    3.  06/15: 0 new / 42 susceptible = 0% per day

    4.  *Unit:* proportion per day (new cases per susceptible elk per day, \# infected/ \# at risk)

2.  What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence?

    1.  06/13: 12 infected / 56 = 21.4%

    2.  06/16: 5 infected / 56 = 8.9%

    3.  Proportion of the population infected at a point in time (# infected/total #)

3.  On which day is the prevalence the same as the incidence (except for the units)?

    1.  06/10/25 → Both had a count of 1 case.

4.  On which day is the incidence lowest?

    1.  06/15/25 and 06/16/25 → 0 new cases.

# Tick Identification Write Up - 10/6/25

Tick identification relies on observing key morphological features through a structured approach. The process typically follows the sequence of determining life stage, sex, genus, and species. First, the life stage is identified by checking for a genital pore and counting legs, with six in larvae and eight in nymphs and adults. Next, sex is determined by examining the scutum; males have a full scutum called a conscutum, while females have a smaller one called an alloscutum. Genus identification depends on the position of the anal groove, which may be anterior or posterior to the anus. Species-level identification is achieved using a dichotomous key. The SAM method, which stands for scutum, anal groove, and mouth parts, helps distinguish tick types by observing scutum patterns, anal groove location, and the length of mouth parts. Accurate tick identification is vital in public health because different species transmit specific pathogens such as Lyme disease, Ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Understanding these features supports effective disease surveillance and prevention strategies.

# Test Correction (#7 and #8) - 10/13/25

7.  In 2015, the mass die-off of Saiga antelope in Kazakhstan was caused by a bacterial infection from *Pasteurella multocida* type B, which is normally harmless in healthy animals but became deadly under unusually warm and humid conditions. These environmental changes triggered the bacteria, already present in the animals’ respiratory tracts, to turn virulent and cause hemorrhagic septicemia, leading to rapid death across entire herds within days. The dense grouping of Saigas during calving season further accelerated disease transmission and mortality. To prevent similar events, conservationists could establish early-warning systems that monitor weather patterns, herd health, and soil or microbial conditions linked to outbreaks. Regular disease surveillance, carcass disposal protocols, and genetic diversity management would also reduce vulnerability. Broader conservation strategies should focus on maintaining large, connected populations across multiple regions, reducing poaching, and protecting habitat corridors so that Saigas can disperse and avoid catastrophic losses from localized disease outbreaks. Strengthening international cooperation for disease response and data sharing would further safeguard the species from extinction.

8.  Yes, I agree with Aldo Leopold’s perspective that wildlife disease is largely an ecological issue influenced by human actions. Human-driven habitat changes, climate shifts, and artificial animal concentrations often create conditions that favor disease outbreaks. For example, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in deer has spread more rapidly because of captive deer farming and the transport of animals across states—human activities that disrupt natural population structures. Similarly, the spread of chytridiomycosis in amphibians has been linked to the global pet trade and movement of infected species, such as the African clawed frog, which introduced the fungus to new ecosystems. These examples show that many wildlife diseases emerge or intensify when human behavior alters ecological balance, supporting Leopold’s view that managing disease requires understanding and addressing our own environmental impacts.
