Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The epidemiological triad is a model used to explain how diseases occur and spread. It consists of three interconnected components: the host (the organism that can get the disease), the agent (the pathogen or cause of the disease, such as a virus, bacterium, or parasite), and the environment (the external factors that influence disease transmission, like climate, sanitation, or living conditions). Disease develops when these three elements interact in a way that allows the agent to infect the host under favorable environmental conditions. This model helps researchers and health professionals understand and control the spread of diseases.

Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

![](images/clipboard-1408093617.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
    herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    The necessary sample size is 59

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:\

    a)  95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population. 299\
    b)  99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population. 229

    The sample size required for scenario A is larger

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is

    \<1%
