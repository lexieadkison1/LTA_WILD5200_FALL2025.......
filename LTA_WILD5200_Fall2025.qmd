Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The epidemiological triad is a model used to explain how diseases occur and spread. It consists of three interconnected components: the host (the organism that can get the disease), the agent (the pathogen or cause of the disease, such as a virus, bacterium, or parasite), and the environment (the external factors that influence disease transmission, like climate, sanitation, or living conditions). Disease develops when these three elements interact in a way that allows the agent to infect the host under favorable environmental conditions. This model helps researchers and health professionals understand and control the spread of diseases.

Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

![](images/clipboard-1408093617.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
    herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    The necessary sample size is 59

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:\

    a)  95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population. 299\
    b)  99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population. 229

    The sample size required for scenario A is larger

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is

    \<1%

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her\
data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She\
meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:\
RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

1.  Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

    1.  06/12: 5 new / 51 susceptible = 9.8% per day

    2.  06/14: 2 new / 44 susceptible = 4.6% per day

    3.  06/15: 0 new / 42 susceptible = 0% per day

    4.  *Unit:* proportion per day (new cases per susceptible elk per day, \# infected/ \# at risk)

2.  What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence?

    1.  06/13: 12 infected / 56 = 21.4%

    2.  06/16: 5 infected / 56 = 8.9%

    3.  Proportion of the population infected at a point in time (# infected/total #)

3.  On which day is the prevalence the same as the incidence (except for the units)?

    1.  06/10/25 → Both had a count of 1 case.

4.  On which day is the incidence lowest?

    1.  06/15/25 and 06/16/25 → 0 new cases.
